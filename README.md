# OS Project: Preemptive Priority Scheduling

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Preemptive Priority Scheduling** algorithm, a core concept in operating systems. The algorithm schedules processes based on priority, preempting the currently running process if a higher-priority process arrives.

## üìÅ Contents

- `PreemptivePriority.doc`: Documentation detailing the algorithm's implementation, including design decisions, pseudocode, and example scenarios.
- `README.md`: This file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: Processes are scheduled based on priority, with higher-priority processes preempting lower-priority ones.
- **Dynamic Process Handling**: Supports the addition of processes at runtime, adjusting the schedule accordingly.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The accompanying `.doc` file provides in-depth explanations and examples.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
